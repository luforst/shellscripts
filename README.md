# shellscripts
A collection of some convenient shell scripts.

## cleanup-latex.sh
This script deletes all of those helper files generated during a LaTeX compilation.
There is a confirmation prompt.
To be implemented: calculation of the to-be-deleted files' sizes' sum; rm-like options -i, -f, -v, -r

## cleanup-unused.sh
This script deletes thumbnail files and cleans the trash folder.

## pngs2pdf-multipage.sh
This script generated a multi-page PDF document out of all PNG files in a folder.
Wrote it for my studying, because my maths prof seems not to know how to do such things.
